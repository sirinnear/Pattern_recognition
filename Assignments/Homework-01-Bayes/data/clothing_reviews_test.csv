23436,1104,53,Short; more of an empire waist than photo shows,"I'm 5'6"" and it hits me at mid-thigh. the top (black/camel version) is sheer enough to need a cami. the waist is quite high. not flattering for me--the empire waist makes me look a bit pregnant--plus i don't want to deal with having to wear a cami.",3,0,5,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
23443,862,62,Practical and pretty,"Love this cardigan as a wardrobe staple to quickly throw on, especially over dresses (but also anything). it drapes beautifully, and i love the button closure detail. it is definitely a thin, soft, light-weight knit, but i think that makes it practical for year-round use, much like other items by bordeaux.",5,1,0,General Petite,Tops,Knits
23447,1104,28,Fit weird,I really wanted to like this dress and was encouraged by the positive reviews. the dress itself was very comfortable but was very unflattering. the top fabric hit my ribs funny and made me look really wide.,3,0,1,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
23456,1104,35,Flattering and lovely sweater dress,"I have been on a search for a dress with sleeves that cute enough for date night. as a bigger girl than most retailer reviewers, i was happy to find this covered my ample chest and between the crosswrap and a little flare in the skirt it camoflauges my belly. it is a sweater dress, which is not easily noticable in the web photos, and can certainly be dressed up for a dinner or for the office.",5,1,3,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
23467,1104,60,Super flattering!,"I worry when i have an elastic waist, or something that resembles this, but the dress hangs like a dream.
no puffing out, no gathers that you can see.
it is not sheath, but not a line either, kind of in between, hits several inches above my knees, but perfect with some black tights for winter. i saw the note about grey, have to try it on agin in daylight, but i would say think black on the top, light camel color on the bottom
i am 5'8, typically wear a size 12, and it was true to size for me

23478,1104,32,Unflattering,I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.,1,0,0,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
23482,862,48,Wish it was made of cotton,"It reminds me of maternity clothes. soft, stretchy, shiny material. cut is flattering and drapes nicely. i only found one button to close front... looked awkward. nice long sleeves.
not for me but maybe for others. just ok.",3,1,0,General Petite,Tops,Knits
23483,1104,31,"Cute, but see through","This fit well, but the top was very see through. this never would have worked for me. i'm glad i was able to try it on in the store and didn't order it online. with different fabric, it would have been great.",3,0,1,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
